I sat in the quiet room, the sun setting outside the window, casting an orange glow on the walls. The letter in my hand felt heavy, as if it 
carried more than just ink on paper. It had arrived earlier today, sealed with a wax stamp I had not seen in years.

As I unfolded the letter, my mind raced with thoughts of the past. It was from my old comrade, who I had not heard from since the mission 
years ago. 

The letter was short but meaningful:
“The night is always darkest before the dawn. Keep the faith. The key to everything is hidden in plain sight. 
Follow the path, and you’ll find what you seek. Trust no one but yourself.”

I folded the letter back, pondering the words carefully. My comrade was always cryptic, but I knew better than to 
take anything lightly. There was always something more beneath the surface. I would have to decode this, piece by piece, just like we used to.
